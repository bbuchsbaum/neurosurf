Description: A comprehensive toolkit for working with surface-based neuroimaging data
    represented as triangle meshes. The package provides classes and methods for 
    creating, manipulating, and visualizing 3D surface geometries (e.g., cortical 
    surfaces), with support for various file formats including FreeSurfer and GIFTI. 
    Key features include: surface smoothing, curvature computation, neighborhood graph 
    construction, geodesic distance calculations, searchlight analysis for surface-based 
    machine learning, and interactive 3D visualization via HTMLWidgets. The package 
    facilitates advanced surface-based analyses through specialized data structures 
    for representing surface geometry and associated functional data.
