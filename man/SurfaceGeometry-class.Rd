\title{SurfaceGeometry Class}
\description{
The `SurfaceGeometry` class represents a three-dimensional surface consisting of a set of triangle vertices.
It encapsulates the mesh structure, graph representation, and hemisphere information of a brain surface.
}
\details{
This class is fundamental for representing brain surface geometries in neuroimaging analyses.
The mesh slot contains the vertex and face information, while the graph slot provides
a network representation of the surface topology. The hemi slot specifies which
hemisphere the surface represents.
}

\describe{
\item{\code{mesh}}{An object of class \code{mesh3d} representing the underlying 3D mesh structure.}

\item{\code{graph}}{An object of class \code{igraph} representing the underlying graph structure of the surface.}

\item{\code{hemi}}{A character string indicating the hemisphere of the surface ("left", "right", or "both").}
