\title{Construct a Graph from Mesh Vertices and Faces}
\usage{
meshToGraph(vertices, nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{vertices}{A numeric matrix with 3 columns representing the x, y, and z coordinates of vertices.
Each row corresponds to a vertex.}

\item{nodes}{A numeric matrix where each row represents a face, containing indices of three vertices that form the face.}
}
\value{
An \code{igraph} object representing the mesh connectivity. The graph has the following attributes:
  \itemize{
    \item Vertex attributes: "x", "y", and "z" coordinates
    \item Edge attribute: "dist" (Euclidean distance between connected vertices)
  }

an \code{igraph} instance representing th mesh connectivity.
}
\description{
This function creates an igraph object representing the connectivity of a 3D mesh
from its vertices and faces.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Constructs edges from the face information
  \item Creates an undirected graph from these edges
  \item Simplifies the graph to remove multiple edges and loops
  \item Calculates Euclidean distances between connected vertices
  \item Adds vertex coordinates and edge distances as attributes
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
vertices <- matrix(rnorm(30), ncol=3)
faces <- matrix(sample(1:10, 30, replace=TRUE), ncol=3)
graph <- meshToGraph(vertices, faces)
print(graph)
}
