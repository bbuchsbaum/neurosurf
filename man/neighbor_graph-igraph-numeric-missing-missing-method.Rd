\title{Create Neighbor Graph from igraph Object}
\usage{
\S4method{neighbor_graph}{igraph,numeric,missing,missing}(
  x,
  radius,
  distance_type = c("geodesic", "euclidean", "spherical")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An igraph object representing the original graph}

\item{radius}{Numeric; the spatial radius within which to consider nodes as neighbors}

\item{distance_type}{Character; type of distance metric to use: "geodesic", "euclidean", or "spherical"}
}
\value{
An igraph object representing the neighbor graph
}
\description{
Constructs a neighbor graph from an igraph object based on a specified radius.
}
\details{
This method creates a neighbor graph by finding all nodes within the specified radius
for each node in the input graph. Edge weights are taken from the 'dist' attribute
of the input graph's edges.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
g <- make_graph("Zachary")
E(g)$dist <- runif(ecount(g))
neighbor_g <- neighbor_graph(g, radius = 0.5, distance_type = "geodesic")
}
